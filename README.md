### Hi there 👋, I'm Paul

I'm a **Software Architect** and **Ph.D. student in Medical Informatics**, passionate about building good software.

## 💼 Professional

As a **software architect**, I focus on creating robust systems, improving developer experience, and enabling clean, maintainable codebases.

- 🛠️ Tech stack: Python, TypeScript, Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Azure  
- 🧰 Using tools like `ruff`, `uv`, `pytest`, `mypy`, `pre-commit`, and `devcontainer` to automate code quality and enforcement  
- 🔄 Promoting clean architecture, typed APIs, and modular design patterns  
- 🚀 Setting up CI/CD pipelines (`GitHub Actions` or `Azure Pipelines`) and testing workflows for rapid, safe delivery  
- 🧑‍💻 Passionate about internal tooling, documentation (e.g. [ADRs](https://adr.github.io/) and [ARC42](https://docs.arc42.org/home/)), and developer experience  
- 📦 Dev environment: see my [DevContainer Python template project](https://github.com/Paul-B98/python-project-template)

## 🎓 Academic

As a **Ph.D. student in medical informatics**, I'm trying to make sense of ICU data to develop predictive models that can help improve clinical decisions.

- 🧠 Past research: [pyAKI](https://github.com/aidh-ms/pyAKI) for detecting acute kidney injury within time-series data  
- 🎓 Teaching: my lecture on [AI Bascis](https://github.com/Paul-B98/lecture-ai-basics) and [AI Advanced](https://github.com/Paul-B98/lecture-ai-advanced) can be found on GitHub

## 🧑‍💻 Private

As a **developer in my free time**, I enjoy experimenting with tools and simply learning.

- 📚 Exploring new tools, frameworks, and languages back and forth  
- 📖 Currently learning: `Rust`, ...
- 🧪 Automating tasks, building prototypes, and trying out weekend ideas  
- 🏁 Hackathons: you’ll find me there every year if I have the chance  
- 🛠 Planning `ERP@Home`, a lightweight, modular ERP system for personal use
